5 Listen and say twelfth tree 6 Listen and point cid2cid3 cid5cid3 cid4cid3 cid6cid3 7 Sing We usually wake up at six oclock And we dont usually do anything special. But today were going on a school trip, Were going to visit a castle! We usually travel to school by car And school starts at a quarter to eight. But today were walking across the bridge To get to the castle gate. We usually say goodbye to our friends When school ends at a quarter past one. But today were at the top of the castle Where its nice and warm in the sun. 31
